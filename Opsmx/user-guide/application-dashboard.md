# Application Dashboard

## Application Dashboard

When you log into ISD, the first thing you will see is the Application dashboard. The application dashboard gives you the high-level operational information you need to help you understand the health of all your applications at a glance. In the application dashboard, you can also view the environments and the gates that the service or the application passes through before final deployment.

* After your successful login, the Application Dashboard appears and it gives you high-level overviews of your applications, and pipelines along with the following important operational information:
  1. 1.**Total Applications** - The number of applications to which you have access.
  2. 2.**Deployments** - The total number of deployments, from all the applications to which you have access.
  3. 3.**Pipeline Failures** - Any pipeline failures, in any of the applications to which you have access.
  4. 4.**Pending Approvals** - Any approvals which are pending for your action.
  5. 5.**Policy Violations** - Any policy violations, in any of the applications to which you have access.
  6. 6.**Verification Failures** - Any failures in the verification process within the applications to which you have access.
  7. 7.**Applications** - Names of the each application.
